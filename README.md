# Heart-Disease-Predictor
This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease using machine learning techniques. By analyzing medical attributes such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and ECG results, models like KNN, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest are trained and evaluated. The goal is to provide an early warning system that aids in medical diagnosis.
